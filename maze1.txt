You are walking by a house and you hear screams, you think nothing of it because 
Halloween is around the corner. Then a paper airplane lands at you feet. It reads: 
	"	Listen, I'm in a pickle. I want to start by saying never marry a witch! 
	To cut the long story short, my ex witch of a wife cast a spell on my
	bedroom door--I'm afraid that it is locked for eternity.
		 She left her spell book here, and I found a recipe for a potion
	that allows people to walk through walls! I know I have all of the 
	ingredients in my house. Please go around and collect the items,
	I'll give you more instructions when you collect them all. Also,
	let me apologize in advance for the riddles, potion books are 
	notoriously cryptic. Here's what the recipe calls for:
		- sheet music
		- candle stick
		- small animal pelt
		- hairbrush
	Please try to hurry, I've been trapped in here for a few days and I
	am without water and food."
After reading the plea of a scorned ex-witch's lover, you take it upon
yourself to help the poor sap out.
